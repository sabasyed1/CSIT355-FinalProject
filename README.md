### Features 
The reason behind the website is the site’s main idea is simple to create but not overly simple. The products on the website are Pizza, Specialty Pizza, Side Orders, Pastas, Salad, and Beverages. The pictures of the products are from google.
The views of the website are user and admin. The user is not allowed to do much on the website but to add products to their cart and check out. The admin has administrative functionalities which make the admin different from the user. The search bar allows the user and admin to search up product names. The admin is able to add products into the website, The admin is able to remove products. The modify function is the admin is able to edit the product. The user information is also able to change their email, address, and phone number. 

### More about the site. 
This project is about the creation of NJ Pizzeria website for database systems. The details of what went into this project to create the database and make a functionally running website will be explained. The database aspect of a project is very important on the functionality of how data is being stored and used. The user’s information is being stored into the database. The website takes the data from the database to show results to the user. 
The problem is users are hungry and want Italian food to buy then eat. The solution is allowing users to add products to their cart and to be able to check out with the product that is in their cart. The cart should also show the total amount of the cart. Also, allowing the users to input their delivery location to get their products delivered to them. 

### Results
The result of this project is that most of the project is functional, but I should have spent more time doing the security implementation part of the project. The project creates an account for its users and stores the information into the database. Then, with the information the user used to create the account to log in to their account. The landing page displays the products of the site and shows the nav bar for easier access. The user is then able to add products to the cart. The cart will update with the products that the user selected. The users can also update the quantity of products in their cart. The user can checkout using their shipping information in the checkout and confirming the order with their password. The user can see their previous orders in their order history. The user can log out of the website. The challenges of the website is making the website functional with the database using PHP and mySQL. Further improve on the remove button, the security aspect, and doing the search in PHP. Also, I could have spent more time in adding more features to the admin portion. Final statement is that I tried my best to complete the work within a limited time.
